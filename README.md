It is a simple project, which parses data through an API and displays it locally on your web browser.

I have added virtual environment, please refer to original docs on how to activate a venv (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

And then just run this URL on your browser "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"

I will be adding more functionalities later. Thanks for stopping by.
